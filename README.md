# extract-summit-contest-2024

- https://www.extractsummit.io/coding-contest
- Goal was to create a crawler that extracts all product info according to a given schema
- The main challenge here was there were multiple layouts, so it was handled using Zyte API which uses AI to figure out the layout handling
- Was super fun and challenging
- max_requests was set to 2000 to make sure the spider does not close automatically before all items are crawled, http request method was set instead of the default browser rendering mode
